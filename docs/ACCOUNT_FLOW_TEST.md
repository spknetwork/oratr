# SPK Desktop Account Flow Test Instructions

## What Was Fixed

The account setup flow in SPK Desktop had several issues that made the user experience frustrating:

1. **No auto-activation**: Users had to manually set new accounts as active after adding them
2. **Modal backdrop persistence**: Bootstrap modal backdrops would stick around after dismissing, requiring app restart
3. **Poor first-time UX**: The flow between PIN setup → Account setup → Active account was disjointed

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Auto-Activation of First Account
- **File**: `src/renderer/components/auth.js`
- **Lines**: 421-441 (master password) and 484-504 (private keys)
- **Change**: When adding the first account to an empty wallet, it automatically becomes the active account
- **Triggers**: Account activation event to update the main app UI

### 2. Enhanced Modal Cleanup
- **File**: `src/renderer/components/auth.js` 
- **Lines**: 1063-1102 (`closeAccountManager()` method)
- **Change**: Comprehensive cleanup of modal styles, backdrops, and DOM elements
- **Prevents**: Backdrop persistence and requires app restart

### 3. Streamlined Event Handling
- **File**: `src/renderer/renderer.js`
- **Lines**: 277-287 (account-activated event)
- **Lines**: 289-307 (enhanced unlock event)
- **Change**: Better integration between auth component and main app

## Test Instructions

### Test Case 1: First-Time Setup
1. **Reset the app**: Delete any existing data/config to simulate fresh install
2. **Launch SPK Desktop**
3. **Set PIN**: Create a new PIN (should show PIN setup screen)
4. **Add first account**: Use either Master Password or Private Keys method
5. **Verify**: Account should auto-activate and overlay should close without restart
6. **Expected**: Welcome message appears, account shows in header, no modal backdrop

### Test Case 2: Adding Additional Accounts
1. **With existing account active**: Click "Accounts" button
2. **Add new account**: Use the "Add Account" button
3. **Verify**: New account is added but doesn't auto-activate (preserves current active account)
4. **Expected**: Account manager shows both accounts, original remains active

### Test Case 3: Modal Cleanup
1. **Open account manager**: Click "Accounts" button  
2. **Close with X button**: Click the close (X) button in top-right
3. **Verify**: No backdrop remains, app is fully interactive
4. **Repeat**: Open and close multiple times to test cleanup
5. **Expected**: Clean dismissal every time, no app restart needed

### Test Case 4: PIN Setup Flow
1. **Fresh app**: Start with no PIN set
2. **Create PIN**: Follow PIN setup process
3. **Import account**: Should flow directly to account import
4. **Verify**: Smooth transition from PIN → Account → Active state
5. **Expected**: No manual steps required after account import

## Technical Details

The fixes address these core issues:

- **DOM Cleanup**: Proper removal of event handlers and DOM elements
- **State Management**: Better coordination between auth component and main app  
- **Event Flow**: Custom events for account activation and state changes
- **Style Reset**: Comprehensive CSS style cleanup for modals and backdrops

## Files Modified

1. `src/renderer/components/auth.js` - Main authentication component
2. `src/renderer/renderer.js` - Main renderer process and event handling

The changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience for account setup and management.
