# Oratr Account Setup Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Account Key Field Updates
**Issue**: Key field descriptions were unclear and owner key was exposed unnecessarily.

**Changes Made**:
- **Posting Key**: Shows "(required)" - unchanged
- **Active Key**: Now shows "(optional - wallet operations and registering storage node)"
- **Memo Key**: Now shows "(optional - used for end to end encryption)"
- **Owner Key**: Completely removed from both add account and edit account screens

**Files Modified**:
- `src/renderer/components/auth.js` (lines 344-356, 728-740, 754-773, 786, 792-810)

### 2. Tab Content Not Showing After Account Setup
**Issue**: After completing account setup, the main app would show but tabs wouldn't display their content, requiring an app restart.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `showApp()` function was missing entirely
- The `showTab()` function was missing entirely
- The app element wasn't being properly displayed after auth overlay closed

**Changes Made**:

#### Added `showApp()` Function:
- Shows the main app by setting `display: 'block'`
- Hides auth container
- Ensures default tab is active
- Mounts drive component if needed

#### Added `showTab()` Function:
- Handles tab switching logic
- Shows/hides tab content appropriately
- Updates tab button active states
- Handles tab-specific initialization (drive mounting, balance refresh, etc.)

#### Enhanced Auth Flow:
- `closeAccountManager()` now properly shows the app with `app.style.display = 'block'`
- `account-activated` event now calls `showApp()` to ensure app is visible
- Auto-activation flow properly transitions from auth to main app

**Files Modified**:
- `src/renderer/components/auth.js` (line 1103)
- `src/renderer/renderer.js` (lines 289, 4625-4735)

### 3. Complete Owner Key Removal
**Issue**: Owner key was still visible in account management screens.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed owner key input field from add account form
- Removed owner key status from edit account screen
- Removed owner key input field from edit account form
- Updated JavaScript logic to not process owner key
- Updated form validation to not expect owner key

## Testing Checklist

### Fresh Account Setup Flow:
1. **Launch Oratr** - Should show "Welcome to Oratr" screen
2. **Set PIN** - Should flow to account import
3. **Import Account** - Should show proper key descriptions:
   - Posting: (required)
   - Active: (optional - wallet operations and registering storage node)
   - Memo: (optional - used for end to end encryption)
   - Owner: Should not be visible
4. **Account Creation** - Should auto-activate and show welcome message
5. **App Display** - Should immediately show main app with tabs working
6. **Tab Navigation** - All tabs should show their content properly

### Account Management:
1. **Edit Account** - Owner key should not be visible in status or input
2. **Tab Switching** - Should work smoothly without requiring restart
3. **App Restart** - Should work as before with existing accounts

## Technical Details

### Event Flow:
1. User completes account setup
2. `account-activated` event is dispatched
3. `showApp()` is called
4. Auth overlay is hidden, main app is shown
5. Default tab (drive) is activated
6. Components are mounted as needed

### Key Functions Added:
- `showApp()`: Controls app visibility and initialization
- `showTab(tabName)`: Handles tab switching and content display
- Enhanced `closeAccountManager()`: Properly shows app after auth

### Security Improvement:
- Owner key is no longer exposed in UI, reducing risk of accidental exposure
- Clear labeling helps users understand which keys are needed for what operations

## Files Changed Summary:
- `src/renderer/components/auth.js`: Account setup forms and auth flow
- `src/renderer/renderer.js`: App display logic and tab management

These fixes ensure a smooth first-time user experience with proper account setup flow and immediate access to all app functionality without requiring restarts.
